# Working Together
React gets big and messy real quick. Gatsby's a great low-commitment way to practice some React without wondering how you're going to do authentication or what your boss thinks of switching from Ember to React + Redux.

The talk gives a decent walkthrough, but I also want to leave you with the chance to do some of this at home.

Gatsby is built with Node.js v4 and npm v3, so you'll need to check if at least those versions are installed.

```node --version```

```npm --version```

If Node.js isn't install, go to https://nodejs.org/ and install the recommended version for your OS.

## First Gatsby

In order to create your first Gatsby project, you install Gatsby to your machine:

```npm install --global gatsby-cli```

Then you can create your project:

```gatsby new chance-the-rapper```

Go into this directory that you've created on your machine and run this new command you've just enabled by installing.

```gatsby develop```

Now go to your browser and check out `localhost:8000`. You should see a default Gatsby site that you can work with as a foundation for your new site.
